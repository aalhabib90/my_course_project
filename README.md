 This code uses Node.js with the commander package to create a simple command-line todo list application. Here's a breakdown in simpler terms:

    Imports: It imports necessary modules (commander and chalk) required for creating the command-line application.

    Todo List Setup: Initializes an empty array called todo to store tasks.

    Setting up the Program:
        Initializes the program using commander.
        Specifies the version of the program as 1.0.0.
        Describes the program as a 'Simple todo list'.

    Adding a Task:
        Defines a command 'add' using .command('add <task>').
        Describes this command as 'Add new task'.
        Specifies the action to take when this command is invoked:
            Adds the task provided as a command-line argument to the todo list.
            Prints a message in green color to confirm the addition of the task.

    Listing Tasks:
        Defines a command 'list' using .command('list').
        Describes this command as 'List all tasks'.
        Specifies the action to take when this command is invoked:
            Prints a green-colored header for the todo list.
            Loops through each task in the todo array, displaying them with their index number.

    Parsing Command Line Arguments:
        Uses program.parse(process.argv) to parse the command line arguments and execute the appropriate command based on the user input.

In summary, this code sets up a command-line application that allows users to add tasks and list all the tasks in a simple todo list format using specific commands like add and list.
